# Chapter 2 Capstone Exercise

## Context

In this capstone exercise, you will apply the concepts and skills learned in this chapter to train a distributed deep learning model using TensorFlow. The dataset we will use is a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains images of 10 different classes. You will preprocess the data, distribute the training across multiple nodes, and evaluate the performance of the model. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of distributed training and demonstrate the advantages of parallelizing workloads in deep learning.

## Instructions
- Preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset for training.
- Set up a distributed strategy for training the model.
- Build and compile a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- Train the model using the distributed strategy and evaluate its performance.
